However, that’s rather difficult to achieve, even if somewhow we’re able to, it will certainly come with a cost like any other.\nOk then what’s the approach we should take to tackle this delicate matter?\nokay first we’ll have to list our priorities\n Rapid feature release Ease of tweaking Maintainability of said features  My answer is to combine the speed of mobile warfare and the organization of grand battle plan, is that even possible?\nYes, I call it the Nimble Forsythia.\nIn short this war doctrine design philosopy start with anticipating apparent problems and ignoring scary but vague problems and then goes into full speed while doing a little cleaning along the way by the end of a major patch we’ll take a brake and see if there’s new apparent problem and then adress it if there’s any.\nThere’s three main component to this philosopy\n Compound Battle Plan Relentless Execution Litter pick-up  Compound Battle Plan In traditional SDLC the planning will be done once at the start of the project, However we’ll do it after every major patch.\nContrary to other software project we don’t have the luxury of knowing everything at the very beginning, so to cope with that we’ll do smaller design phase multiple times.\nThis short planning phase will result in faster features being done but if we’re not careful the whole thing can crumble, that’s where the Litter Pick-up and the compound part come into play.\nAfter the end of every major patch, the code will start to tangle into spaghet but it won’t be too spaghet, Litter Pick-up will clean the smaller spaghet and the planning phase at the start of the next cycle will fix glaring architectural problems.\nRelentless Execution After the planning phase is completed we’re going to switch into full flank speed and try to follow the set guidelines but don’t show any hesitation don’t think of problems that might come in the future.\nBut isn’t this dangerous? Yes, but our first priority is to ship the features first so it’s fine and also there’s two percautions set in place to prevent too much damage which are:\n Unit testing Litter Pick-up  Unit testing discourage us from coupling system too much, because well the test won’t run if the scene can’t work by itself.\nAnd Litter Pick-up untangle mess before it reach a critical point.\nLitter Pick-up To put it simply Litter-pickup is a refactoring process that’s being done after every feature release which focus on cleaning the small but numerous mess we’ve created during the creation of said feature.\n Info This refactoring process focus on cleaning little spaghet tomfoolery instead of the bigger architectural problems.\n  ",

    "content": "Base Paradigm The official godot documentation favor traditional OOP over any other paradigm mainly ECS and we’re going to follow that, but it’s not restricting as in godot also offer a high level composition with scene but it’ll be primarily composed with Inheritance\nCall Down Signal Up As a rule of thumb Parent should manage it’s child, and the child shouldn’t call the parent directly. If the child need the parent to do something it should use a signal.\nExample:\n// Do // Call Down get_node(\"child\").do_something() // Signal Up signal child_hurt func damaged(): emit_signal(\"child_hurt\") func _on_child_hurt(): // do_something()  // Don't // Call up get_node(\"../..\").parent_do_something() Inheritance over Composition As mentioned above godot favor Inheritance over Composition for example A player class would look like this\nEntity -\u003e Character instead of\nCharacter Control Sprite ... But since godot support combining scens togther it will usually looks like this\nKinematicBody2D -\u003e Entity -\u003e Character -\u003e Sprite -\u003e Area2D -\u003e Hitbox -\u003e Area2d -\u003e Hurtbox -\u003e Node2D -\u003e Weapon In this specific project, we should encourage shallow Inheritance but wide.\nContext Based Coupling Objects should be coupled when they’re related enough.\nExample:\nA player will have a sprite and this instance of sprite is specifically exist for the player itself so any other object will not cares about its existence is the character base class therefore it’s safe to tightly couple them.\nIf it’s not related enough, do not couple them\nExample:\nAn npc have the ability to prompt dialog, so at a first glance it is reasonable to put the dialog node inside the scene tree of that NPC but dialog can also can be called other than NPC so it’s a bad idea to couple them together, if this is the case please refer to Global Signal.\nSignal and Global Signal This is an extennsion of the regular Signal pattern the regular signal pattern usually used when a child needs to notify its parent that something happened, if that’s the case a regular signal will do wonders but when other Node needs to know something happened but doesn’t have a direct connection to the Node that’s when we should use Global Signal.\nWe will use a forbidden technique here:\nSingleton\nCalm dowm, this is probably one of the safest singleton that we can use because it doesn’t create any tight coupling\nIt will only provide an easy access to connect a signal. Example:\nHUD \u003c-\u003e Global Signal \u003c-\u003e Character\nCharacter will send a signal that something happened but doesn’t care who received that signal so even when the signal sender is gone there will be no crash since there’s no direct donnection\nSo when to use Global Signal?\nWe want to use signal if two or more object cares about it’s significance\nExample:\nWhen enemy hitbox enters player’s hurtbox the player base class needs to know that it happened so it can reduce the player’s health and at the same time the UI also needs to know that to update the Health Bar.\nWhen to not use Global Signal?\nIf the receiver has a more convinient way to connect to the signal then it’s best to not use a Global Signal\nSo there will be a singleton named SignalManager that’ll act as a bridge between nodes, and any node can send and receive signal to and from this singleton.\nAssumption is Evil Do not assume that something will exist, that’s a quick and easy way to create a debugging hell.\nFor example:\nThe enemy needs player position at all times for it to works, this is an assumption it assumes that the player will exist no matter what but in reality this is hard to achieve, the enemy ai can exist before the player or the player may die and dissapear from meory in that case the entire game will break.\nSince GDScript is not enforcing any kind of safety regarding this we have to improvise and restrain ourself from using unsafe reference.\nUnsafe refrence usually is a fruit of a quick solution that our head conjure and more often than not the first solution that came into our head isn’t the greatest, so just keep in mind that when we create an unsafe reference there might be a better way of doing it.\nFinite State Machine We’ll be using FSM to manage controlled entity, because it’s simple enough to impelement but more importantly controlled entity is predictable this prevent the FSM to blow up in lines, and we’re not going to use it to control uncontrolled entity.\nFor the current implementation of the State Machine please read the code under common/state_machine.gd it heavily use polymorphism to generalize things.\nBehaviour Tree This is a solution to define the behaviour of an uncontrolled entity, Altho this is way more boiler plate up front and is harder to understand but it ultimately better for complex but predictable behavior.\nIf we’re using FSM for contorlling enemy behavior it can work for simpler enemy but at a certain threshold even adding just one state will require a lot of modification to existing code and that’s less than desirable with Behaviour Tree adding new behavior is more cost effective, and somewhere down the road we’ll a boss enemy which will definitely have a lot behavior and that’s going to be realy messy.\nWe’re not gonna implement our own Behaviour Tree instead we’re going to use a Plugin for it.\nSingleton I know, I know, I’ve been saying that I hate this one pattern but it’s somewhat unavoidable there’s no escaping it, we’re just going to have to use it better.\nAs a rule of them if the singleton can exist in another game without a lot of modification then it’s generic enough to be a singleton after all most of the problem with signleton is the tight coupling and it it’s not tight and just provide an easy acess to something then yeah that’s nice.\n",
